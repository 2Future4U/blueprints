React components for building Primer documentation sites!

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress alert!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
- The repository is brand new as of 2.20.19 and is still very much a work in progress. Please don't use it in production yet, you've been warned.

### üëÄ COMING SOON! üëÄ
- Utilities for building docs sites using Next.js


### But that's not all!
You can also clone this repository and spin up a docs site of your own! In the future, we'd like to make this process much simpler, but for now there are a few things you'll need to do after you clone:

1. Rename the `docs-components` folder in `/pages` to whatever you'd like your root url to be.

2. Find and replace `docs-components` with whichever name you chose in step 1.

3. Delete the `src` folder!

4. Update package.json with the appropriate values for name, version, description, etc.
